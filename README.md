0. New node
   mandatory
   Write a function that creates a binary tree node

Prototype: `binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
Where parent is a pointer to the parent node of the node to create
And value is the value to put in the new node
When created, a node does not have any child
Your function must return a pointer to the new node, or NULL on failure

```
alex@/tmp/binary_trees$ cat 0-main.c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include "binary_trees.h"

/**
 * main - Entry point
 *
 * Return: Always 0 (Success)
 */
int main(void)
{
    binary_tree_t *root;

    root = binary_tree_node(NULL, 98);

    root->left = binary_tree_node(root, 12);
    root->left->left = binary_tree_node(root->left, 6);
    root->left->right = binary_tree_node(root->left, 16);

    root->right = binary_tree_node(root, 402);
    root->right->left = binary_tree_node(root->right, 256);
    root->right->right = binary_tree_node(root->right, 512);

    binary_tree_print(root);
    return (0);
}

1. Insert left
   mandatory
   Write a function that inserts a node as the left-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t `*binary_tree_insert_left(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the left-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a left-child, the new node must take its place, and the old left-child must be set as the left-child of the new node.

2. Insert right
   mandatory
   Write a function that inserts a node as the right-child of another node

Prototype: binary_tree_t `*binary_tree_insert_right(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);`
Where parent is a pointer to the node to insert the right-child in
And value is the value to store in the new node
Your function must return a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure or if parent is NULL
If parent already has a right-child, the new node must take its place, and the old right-child must be set as the right-child of the new node.
